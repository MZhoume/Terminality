## Development Plan

To do:

- ReadTheDocs (more proper documentation)

Features

- Scope based command - command can be run only within specified scope
  (not only root scope)
- Multi-value macros - macro which concatenate multiple values (useful on
  multi-argument command and also multi-selection)
